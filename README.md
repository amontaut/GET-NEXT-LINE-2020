# GET-NEXT-LINE-2020

Get_next_line graded 102 by the holy moulinette on December 24, 2020. *GNL to be optimized tough.* 

The `test-main.c` file tests the project GNL without bonuses. In addition to my own little tester, I used 42TESTERS-GNL (https://github.com/Mazoise/42TESTERS-GNL), gnl lover (https://github.com/charMstr/GNL_lover), gnl killer (https://github.com/DontBreakAlex/gnlkiller), gnl unit test (https://github.com/harm-smits/gnl-unit-test) and gnl smasher (https://github.com/aurelien-brabant/gnl-smasher).
