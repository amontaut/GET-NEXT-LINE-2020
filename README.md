# GET-NEXT-LINE-2020

Get_next_line graded 102 by the holy moulinette on xmas ðŸŽ„ December 24, 2020 ðŸŽ„ with the Norm v2. *GNL to be optimized tough.* 

## In this repo, you will find : 
- FINAL-GNL : where all functions are
- SUBJECT-GNL-fr.pdf : the subject in french ðŸ¥–
- text.txt : a simple .txt file you need to test the program. The content of this file will be read and printed.
- The `test-main.c` file tests the project GNL without bonuses. To compile the test file, clone this repo then run `gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -g3 -fsanitize=address test_main.c FINAL-GNL/*.c && ./a.out text.txt`


In addition to my own little tester, I used 42TESTERS-GNL (https://github.com/Mazoise/42TESTERS-GNL), gnl lover (https://github.com/charMstr/GNL_lover), gnl killer (https://github.com/DontBreakAlex/gnlkiller), gnl unit test (https://github.com/harm-smits/gnl-unit-test) and gnl smasher (https://github.com/aurelien-brabant/gnl-smasher). 

ðŸŽ„ Merry Xmas ! ðŸŽ„
